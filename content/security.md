# Important Security Notice

Setting up AI Agents security for your organization is crucial. When implementing AI Agents, consider all aspects, including Docker, Kubernetes, LLM Models, Prompt Logs, API access, Telemetry data, RAG database, web crawlers, single sign-on, authentication, authorization, and cybersecurity etc..

A small mistake can cause huge problems.

> Youâ€™re permitting AI agents to access sensitive information, read, write, and interpret private data, as well as execute code. If not configured properly, this could end up causing more harm to your organization than good.

# Disclaimer

Writing AI Agents is hard, it's not an easy ride, I will do many mistakes and so will you.
Pardon, refactor and move on.

In this book, I'll start by writing some terrible code and then fix it gradually as I learn more about how to use the framework.

Pardon, refactor and move on.
