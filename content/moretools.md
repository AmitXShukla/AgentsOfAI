# More Tool Functions

Before we conclude this discussion about the Tool functions, I’d like to share some additional code examples with you. 

This information is supplementary, but it’s something we’ll use frequently later on, so it’s worth learning how to work with it now.

By doing so, you’ll be better prepared to handle more significant tasks when we work on actual production-ready code.

** This is sample practice code. It will be improved later when we learn about better, advanced tools for the tasks.

## Employee Database

- SQLite - Employee Database, Assignment, Expense Table, ERD
- SQLite - Issues/Tickets status Database

## FAQ Knowledge Database

- ChromaDB RAG of Employee HR Policy
- PDF, Job aids, videos, audios, meeting notes
- ChromaDB RAG of FAQ, Ticket, resolution

## Website Crawlers

- Company website crawlers

```{warning}
Many modern websites block web crawlers. To bypass this, tools like Microsoft Omniparser or OpenAI Operator use screenshots to extract information from static sites. Before using these methods, ensure you have the right code and proper approval. Crawling company documents without permission can lead to legal issues.

## Face Recognition : FAISS Vector Datastore

- FAISS Vector Index - Employee Image database
```{warning}
Saving employee pictures, addresses, and other biometric information is sensitive. Ensure you comply with all legal requirements before using and storing this data.
